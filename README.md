This project provisions a production-style AWS infrastructure using Terraform with a modular architecture.
It demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices, including network isolation, security, scalability, and reusability.

The infrastructure simulates a real-world backend application deployed on AWS, following common DevOps and cloud architecture patterns.

How to Deploy:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
